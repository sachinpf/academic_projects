## 🏗️ Core Concepts

### Q1: What is a web service?
**Answer:** A web service is a software component that makes its functionality available over the internet using standard protocols (HTTP/HTTPS). It allows different applications to communicate and share data regardless of programming language or platform.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Platform Independent**: Can be accessed by any client that speaks HTTP
- **Language Agnostic**: Client and server can use different programming languages
- **Stateless**: Each request contains all information needed to process it
- **Network-Based**: Accessible over the internet or intranet

**Example:**
```
[Mobile App] ----HTTP Request----> [Weather API Service]
                                          |
                <---JSON Response--- (Temperature: 72°F)
```

### Q2: What's the difference between a website and a web service?
**Answer:**
- **Website**: Designed for human users, returns HTML/CSS/JS for browsers to render
- **Web Service**: Designed for software, returns structured data (JSON/XML) for programs to process

```
Website Flow:
User → Browser → Server → HTML Page → Visual Display

Web Service Flow:
App → HTTP Client → API Server → JSON Data → App Processing
```

### Q3: What is an API (Application Programming Interface)?
**Answer:** An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate. Think of it as a contract that defines:
- **What** operations are available
- **How** to request them
- **What** data format to expect back

**Restaurant Analogy:**
- **API** = Menu (shows available options)
- **API Call** = Placing an order
- **API Response** = Getting your food

## 🏛️ Architecture Patterns

### Q4: What is a monolithic architecture?
**Answer:** A monolithic architecture is where all application components are built as a single, unified unit.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│      Monolithic Application     │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────────┐ │
│  │   UI    │   │   Business   │ │
│  │ Layer   │   │    Logic     │ │
│  └─────────┘   └─────────────┘ │
│  ┌─────────────────────────┐   │
│  │    Database Layer       │   │
│  └─────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
         Single Deployment Unit
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to develop initially
- Easy to test as one unit
- Simple deployment
- Good for small applications

**Cons:**
- Difficult to scale specific features
- Technology lock-in
- One bug can bring down entire system
- Harder to understand as it grows

### Q5: What is microservices architecture?
**Answer:** Microservices architecture breaks an application into small, independent services that communicate over networks.

```
┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│   User       │  │   Product    │  │   Payment    │
│   Service    │  │   Service    │  │   Service    │
└──────┬───────┘  └──────┬───────┘  └──────┬───────┘
       │                 │                   │
       └─────────────────┴───────────────────┘
                         │
                   ┌─────┴─────┐
                   │ API Gateway│
                   └─────┬─────┘
                         │
                   ┌─────┴─────┐
                   │  Client   │
                   └───────────┘
```

**Pros:**
- Independent scaling
- Technology flexibility
- Fault isolation
- Easier to understand individual services

**Cons:**
- Complex communication
- Distributed system challenges
- More operational overhead
- Network latency

### Q6: When should I use monolithic vs microservices?

| Factor | Use Monolithic When | Use Microservices When |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Team Size | Small team (<10) | Large teams |
| Project Complexity | Simple, well-defined scope | Complex, evolving requirements |
| Scale Requirements | Predictable load | Variable load, need selective scaling |
| Time to Market | Need quick MVP | Have time for proper setup |
| DevOps Maturity | Limited DevOps experience | Strong DevOps culture |

## 🌐 Web Services Fundamentals

### Q7: What are RESTful APIs?
**Answer:** REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for web services using HTTP methods meaningfully.

**HTTP Methods & Their Purpose:**
```
GET    /users     → Retrieve all users
GET    /users/123 → Retrieve specific user
POST   /users     → Create new user
PUT    /users/123 → Update entire user
PATCH  /users/123 → Update part of user
DELETE /users/123 → Delete user
```

**RESTful Principles:**
1. **Client-Server**: Separation of concerns
2. **Stateless**: Each request is independent
3. **Cacheable**: Responses can be cached
4. **Uniform Interface**: Consistent naming and behavior
5. **Layered System**: Can have intermediary servers

### Q8: What is JSON and why is it used?
**Answer:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format that's easy for humans to read and machines to parse.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "roles": ["admin", "user"],
    "active": true
  }
}
```

**Why JSON?**
- Human-readable
- Language independent
- Smaller than XML
- Native JavaScript support
- Wide tool support

### Q9: What are HTTP status codes?
**Answer:** Status codes indicate the result of an HTTP request.

**Common Status Codes:**
```
2xx Success
├── 200 OK              → Request successful
├── 201 Created         → Resource created
└── 204 No Content      → Success, no data to return

4xx Client Errors
├── 400 Bad Request     → Invalid request format
├── 401 Unauthorized    → Authentication required
├── 403 Forbidden       → Access denied
└── 404 Not Found       → Resource doesn't exist

5xx Server Errors
├── 500 Internal Error  → Server problem
├── 502 Bad Gateway     → Invalid response from upstream
└── 503 Unavailable     → Server temporarily down
```

## 📁 Repository Organization

### Q10: Why should service code be in separate repositories?
**Answer:** Separate repositories provide isolation and independence for different services.

**Benefits:**
1. **Independent Deployment**: Deploy services without affecting others
2. **Team Ownership**: Different teams can own different repos
3. **Version Control**: Each service has its own version history
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Service-specific build and test processes
5. **Security**: Limit access to specific codebases

**Repository Structure Example:**
```
company-github/
├── user-service/          # Handles user authentication
├── payment-service/       # Processes payments
├── notification-service/  # Sends emails/SMS
├── frontend-app/         # React/Vue/Angular app
└── shared-libraries/     # Common utilities
```

### Q11: What is a monorepo and when should I use it?
**Answer:** A monorepo contains code for multiple projects in a single repository.

```
monorepo/
├── packages/
│   ├── web-app/
│   ├── mobile-app/
│   ├── api-server/
│   └── shared-utils/
├── package.json
└── lerna.json         # Monorepo management tool
```

**Use Monorepo When:**
- Strong code sharing needs
- Small to medium team
- Want atomic commits across services
- Unified versioning important

**Use Separate Repos When:**
- Large organization
- Independent team ownership
- Different deployment cycles
- Varying security requirements

### Q12: How should I structure a modern web application?
**Answer:** Modern applications typically separate concerns into distinct layers:

```
my-app/
├── frontend/              # Client-side application
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/   # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── pages/       # Page components
│   │   ├── services/    # API communication
│   │   └── utils/       # Helper functions
│   └── public/          # Static assets
│
├── backend/              # Server-side application
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── controllers/ # Request handlers
│   │   ├── models/      # Data models
│   │   ├── services/    # Business logic
│   │   └── utils/       # Helper functions
│   └── tests/           # Test files
│
└── infrastructure/       # Deployment configs
    ├── docker/
    ├── kubernetes/
    └── terraform/
```

## 🔄 Development Workflows

### Q13: What is version control and why use Git?
**Answer:** Version control tracks changes to code over time, enabling collaboration and history tracking.

**Git Benefits:**
- **History**: See who changed what and when
- **Branching**: Work on features in isolation
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers, no conflicts
- **Backup**: Distributed copies of code
- **Rollback**: Undo problematic changes

**Basic Git Workflow:**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-payment

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add payment processing"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/add-payment

# Create pull request for review
```

### Q14: What is CI/CD?
**Answer:** 
- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automatically build and test code when changes are pushed
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)**: Automatically deploy tested code to production

```
Developer Push → Build → Test → Deploy to Staging → Deploy to Production
     │            │        │            │                    │
     └── GitHub ──┴── CI Server ───────┴── Automated Pipeline ┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Catch bugs early
- Faster deployment
- Consistent process
- Reduced manual errors

### Q15: What are environments (dev, staging, production)?
**Answer:** Environments are separate instances of your application for different purposes:

```
Development (Local)
    ↓ Push code
Test Environment → Run automated tests
    ↓ Tests pass
Staging Environment → Final testing, mimics production
    ↓ Approved
Production Environment → Live users
```

**Purpose of Each:**
- **Development**: Local coding and testing
- **Test**: Automated testing environment
- **Staging**: Production-like testing
- **Production**: Live application

│ • UI/UX     │            │ • APIs      │
│ • React/Vue │            │ • Database  │
│ • CSS       │            │ • Auth      │
└─────────────┘            └─────────────┘
```

### Q20: What is a database and what types exist?
**Answer:** A database stores and organizes data for efficient retrieval and modification.

**Types:**

**1. Relational (SQL):**
```sql
Users Table          Orders Table
┌────┬──────┐       ┌────┬────────┬────────┐
│ ID │ Name │       │ ID │ UserID │ Amount │
├────┼──────┤       ├────┼────────┼────────┤
│ 1  │ John │       │ 1  │   1    │ $100   │
│ 2  │ Jane │       │ 2  │   2    │ $200   │
└────┴──────┘       └────┴────────┴────────┘
```
Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite

**2. NoSQL:**
```json
// Document Store (MongoDB)
{
  "_id": "user123",
  "name": "John",
  "orders": [
    { "id": "ord1", "amount": 100 },
    { "id": "ord2", "amount": 200 }
  ]
}
```
Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra

### Q21: What is caching?
**Answer:** Caching stores frequently accessed data in fast storage to improve performance.

```
Without Cache:
Client → Server → Database → Process → Response
         (slow, every time)

With Cache:
Client → Server → Cache (fast) → Response
                    ↓ (miss)
                 Database → Update Cache
```

**Common Cache Locations:**
- Browser cache
- CDN cache
- Application cache (Redis)
- Database cache

### Q24: What is scalability?
**Answer:** Scalability is the ability to handle increased load without performance degradation.

**Types:**
```
Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
┌────────┐      ┌────────┐
│ 4GB RAM│  →   │ 16GB RAM│
│ 2 CPU  │      │ 8 CPU  │
└────────┘      └────────┘
  $100/mo        $400/mo

Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
┌────────┐      ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐
│ Server │  →   │Server 1│ │Server 2│ │Server 3│
└────────┘      └────────┘ └────────┘ └────────┘
  $100/mo        $100/mo    $100/mo    $100/mo
```

### Q25: What is security in web development?
**Answer:** Security protects applications and data from unauthorized access and attacks.

**Common Security Concerns:**
1. **Authentication**: Verifying user identity
2. **Authorization**: Checking user permissions
3. **Encryption**: Protecting data in transit (HTTPS)
4. **Input Validation**: Preventing SQL injection, XSS
5. **Rate Limiting**: Preventing abuse
6. **Secrets Management**: Protecting API keys

**Security Best Practices:**
```javascript
// Bad: SQL Injection vulnerable
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// Good: Parameterized query
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [userId]);

// Bad: Storing secrets in code
const apiKey = "sk_live_abc123";

// Good: Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```
